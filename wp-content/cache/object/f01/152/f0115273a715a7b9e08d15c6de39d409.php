However, there comes a time when tree removal is the only way forward. There are many reasons why you may want to consider tree or shrub removal. TopÂ onÂ the list is the need to clear ground for new constructions or to remove dead plants. Plants have a lifespan and when they have reached the end of their life, you will have to remove them from your property. Tree removal is considered when a shrub or tree is beyond redemption.

Conditions that mandate a shrub or tree removal
<ul>
	<li>Soil compaction</li>
	<li>Weather damage</li>
	<li>Disease</li>
	<li>Pollution</li>
	<li>Damage from human activity/interaction</li>
	<li>Risk of the tree damaging a building or the adjacent properties</li>
</ul>
There are two key reasons that mandate tree removal in Markham. The first is when the tree poses the risk of damaging surrounding property and the second is when the tree is beyond redemption. Tree removal is a dangerous task that should be done by skilled experts.
