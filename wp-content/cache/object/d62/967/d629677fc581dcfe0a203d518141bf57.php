Sometimes the plant needs to be removed because it has reached the end of its life and is decaying. When the plant cannot be redeemed, tree removal becomes the only best option.</strong>

Conditions that mandate the removal of a tree or shrubÂ includeÂ the following:
<ul>
	<li>Weather damage</li>
	<li>Soil compaction</li>
	<li>Pollution</li>
	<li>Disease</li>
	<li>When the tree is a risk to the buildings or adjacent properties</li>
	<li>Damage from human interaction/activity</li>
</ul>
There are basically two reasons why a tree removal in Vaughan becomes necessary. When the tree is damaged beyond repair and when a healthy plant poses the risk of damaging surrounding buildings. In some cases tree debris can also clog your air conditioner condenser that can results in a huge <a style="color:#3f3f3f; text-decoration:none;" href="https://www.airmakers.ca/air-conditioner-repair-toronto/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">air conditioner repair</a> expense. Such cases requires a tree removal service.Â  Tree removal is dangerous and should be left to highly skilled tree experts.

If you feel you have a hazardous tree or need to remove a shrub or tree that you believe is irredeemable, contact us for any inspection and removal needs. Al Miley &amp; Associates has the equipment and the skilled team needed to safely assess a tree and help with removal.[/x_text][/x_column][x_column bg_color="" type="1/2"  style="padding: 20px 20px 20px 20px; "][x_custom_headline level="h2" looks_like="h3" accent="false"]Tree Protection Vaughan[/x_custom_headline][x_gap size="30px"][x_text class="left-text "]Trees are a lot like us. They need the care to remain healthy. Just like you trust your doctor to guide you with health care, trees need a trusted tree doctor to monitor and treat them. There are so many tree diseases and insects that can affect the health of trees. While there are situations that mandate the tree to be removed, there are many treatment options that can be used to redeem even a dying tree.

<strong>The most important step in tree protection from pests and diseases is to identify the cause of the problem. Our experienced arborist will correctly diagnose a problem and administer the right treatment.</strong> Our team at Al Miley &amp; Associates has the latest training and education needed to identify the root of a treeâs affliction.

Regular tree maintenance through pruning is recommended for people who want their plants to be in good shape while at the same time boosting the aesthetics of their property.</p>
<h4>Health</h4>
<p>Pruning improves the health of a tree or shrub by improving sunlight penetration, air circulation as well as making the plant less prone to destructive pests. A healthier plant looks better and lives longer. A healthy plant will make your landscape more vibrant while at the same time giving longevity to your landscape.</p>
<h4>Safety</h4>
<p>Professional pruning helps create a safe environment. Pruning involves the removal of dead, broken and weak limbs. Fallen limbs can be hazardous to buildings, people and the landscape. Removing such limbs helps prevent accidents and reduces the risk of damage to your property.</p>
<h4>Manicured landscape</h4>
<p>The main advantage that comes with tree and shrub pruning is the aesthetics. Properly pruned shrubbery and branches create a landscape you can admire. Businesses can enhance their brand image through the natural scenery of their property. The pristine landscape created by properly pruned shrubs and trees will lead to a positive atmosphere.
