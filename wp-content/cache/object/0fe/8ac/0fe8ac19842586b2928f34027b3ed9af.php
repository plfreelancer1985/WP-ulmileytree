We will do whatever it takes to salvage a dying plant. However, there are times when the only option is removal. There are dozens of reasons why people consider the option of shrub or tree removal. The main reasons are to clear ground for construction or to remove a dying tree or shrub. Just like all living things, plants also have a lifespan and when they reach the end of their life, they have to be removed from your yard. With us,Â treeÂ removal is an option we only consider when a tree or shrub is irredeemable.</p>
<p>Conditions that make tree/shrub removal necessary</p>
<ul>
<li>Diseases</li>
<li>Soil compaction</li>
<li>Pollution</li>
<li>Weather damage</li>
<li>Risk of damaging nearby buildings</li>
<li>Damage resulting from human interaction/activities</li>
</ul>
<p>Tree removal is mandatory when a tree poses the risk of damaging property and when it is beyond restoration. Tree removals are dangerous tasks that must be left to <a title="About Us" href="https://www.almileytree.com/about-us-arborist-toronto/">skilled experts</a>.</p>
