It was a rainy day, and your crew didn‚Äôt show up until 4 PM when we were about to give up on having our hedges pruned that day.
Your crew showed up rather tired-looking (who could blame them; they had probably been working all day long in the rain to that point). We thought, ‚Äúoh, no‚Ä¶they‚Äôll be here for hours,‚Äù but they were so efficient at their work and finished in about an hour and a half.
To our delight, the quality of work was even better than we expected. They did an excellent job cutting the edge right up to the face of our chain link fence. The top of the hedge was completely level all the way around (we‚Äôre still wondering how they did that). They did an excellent job cleaning afterwards with a chopper and blower. It was a sheer pleasure to have such a competent, efficient and hard-working crew!<br>

On July 22nd, I had the pleasure of having one of your crews perform a removal for me. I want to thank you for providing me with an amazing crew for my tree removal needs. This group was confident, professional and showed true work integrity.
The experience was worry free, efficient and fun for my whole family. The group handled any situation that arose (i.e., environmentalist calling the city, storm and tornado warnings, etc.) with all expertise. I would highly recommend your company to anyone wanting anything to do with trees. Thank you to all you guys!<br>

They were prompt, efficient and displayed a tremendous degree of respect for my property and that of my neighbours.
They cleaned up extremely thoroughly and were very polite and courteous at all times. Several neighbours witnessed their arrival and departure and commented on the crew‚Äôs high level of professionalism and the quality of service.

I am writing to express my thanks for the excellent level of service provided by your company. The tree was situated very close to my house and even closer to my neighbour‚Äôs house. The task was not an easy one, as all cutting had to be done by climbing and lowering with ropes. Unfortunately, I was unable to stay and watch the entire tree come down. However, I understand there was quite a group of neighbours watching with interest and amazement as this maple came down. Your crew is to be congratulated on their high level of skill of workmanship, courtesy and tidiness shown on the job site.
There is a second silver maple at the back of my yard which will need trimming in the near future. Thank you for your professional service. I will be pleased to recommend your company at any time.<br>

The young man with the chain saw deserves special mention. He did not stop for one minute, not even to take a lunch break. He is an asset to your company.
