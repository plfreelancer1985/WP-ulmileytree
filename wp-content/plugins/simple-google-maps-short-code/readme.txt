A simple shortcode for embedding Google Maps in any WordPress post, page or widget.

== Description ==

This plugin will enable a simple shortcode that you can use for embedding Google Maps in any WordPress post or page. The shortcode uses the [WordPress HTTPS API](http://codex.wordpress.org/HTTP_API) and the [Transients API](http://codex.wordpress.org/Transients_API) for delivering cached Google maps with little to no impact on your site's performance.

Maps are displayed with the [pw_map]] shortcode:

`[pw_map address="New York City" key="YOUR API KEY"]`

Google now requires that new accounts use an API key. You can register a free API key [here](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key#get-an-api-key).

It includes multiple pins support, clustering, pins library, skins, export, import and widget cloning features, Google Analytics integration and premium, USA based support.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

1. Can I change the width or height of the map?

Yes, simply supply a width and height parameter:

`[pw_map address="New York City" width="400px" height="200px" key="YOUR API KEY"]`

You can also use percentages for heights:

`[pw_map address="New York City" width="50%" height="200px" key="YOUR API KEY"]`

2. Can I disable the scroll wheel?

Yes, simple add `enablescrollwheel="false"` to the maps shortcode.

`[pw_map address="New York City" enablescrollwheel="false" key="YOUR API KEY"]`

3. Can I disable the map controls?

Yes, simple add `disablecontrols="true"` to the shortcode.

`[pw_map address="New York City" disablecontrols="true" key="YOUR API KEY"]`

4. How are the maps cached?

Maps are cached using the WordPress [Transients API](http://codex.wordpress.org/Transients_API), which allows for very simple database-based caching.

Each time you display a map, the address specified is used to generate a unique md5 hash, which is used for the cache identifier. This means that if you change the address used for your map, the cache will be refreshed.

5. How often do caches refresh?

The maps are cached for 3 months. Caches are automatically cleared (for individual maps) when you change the address in the shortcode.
